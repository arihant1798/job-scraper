# job-scraper

A web scraper that should extract job data from a job posting website.

The aim is to help the user with the 'job hunting' and employment process.

# Roughly, the program should function by:
* quickly extracting job entries and their key details from a web page, 
* storing that information in a more neutral format (eg: excel file). 
* analysing the extracted data (by keywords, with machine learning, etc) 
* recommending jobs based on the analysis to a particular person with their particular needs

Implementation is to be done by using Python web scraping libraries/modules (mainly requests and BeautifulSoup).
